# Disney Plus Project Introduction

The Disney Plus token project aims to enhance the functionality of the DIS mainnet coin, thereby increasing its application value. This project integrates with a Telegram bot and has achieved phased objectives, offering token exchange and NFT minting features to drive user engagement and broaden the use cases for the DIS mainnet coin.
